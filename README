Media-docker-compose
Version 2

There is now an .env file that contains the VPN info, should not be hard to fill out with your VPN provider of choise.

Also now all services is behind VPN, and here you have a choise.
ports:
            - 8080:80               #muximux
            - 8989:8989             #sonarr
            - 7878:7878             #radarr
            - 6789:6789             #nzbget
            - 9091:9091             #transmisson
            - 3579:3579             #ombi
            - 51413:51413           #transmisson
            - 51413/udp:51413/udp   #transmisson

The first part of the ports are the ones you are gonna use to reach the web ui of every service.
So here you can go wild and give them an unique number!
I got them at 8080, 8081, 8082 and so on.

In the end of the compose-file I use this to connect to my nfs-storage-sever so it is kept just for those in the same situation and I hope it can insprie to add support for smb and what not.

Rock on!
