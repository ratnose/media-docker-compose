Media-docker-compose
Version 3

So after three rains and two snow-blizzards... I am back to where I started pretty much.
Version 3 and 1 is pretty much all the same apart from a few cosmetic changes.

In the end of the compose-file I use this to connect to my nfs-storage-sever so it is kept just for those in the same situation and I hope it can insprie to add support for smb and what not.

Rock on!
